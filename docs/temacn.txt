hi Defrusne,

i maintain Realtek RTL8192EU Linux driver
https://github.com/noud/rtl8192EU_WiFi_linux#supported

You by Temacn do use RTL8192EU WiFi chip as well in your products.
I do not have your USB vendorID and not your productIDs.
So the driver does not work with your products.

May i have your USB vendorID and those productIDs?
So this driver works for your products too.

My mobile no: +31 6 1987 3003

I am then able to make a commit like this where i add Mercusys MW300UM WiFi USB dongle support
https://github.com/noud/rtl8192EU_WiFi_linux/commit/c3e5c2ec54b59657dbf987d8a0489dbf49161bb7

May i have 1 USB RTL8192EU product of yours sent?
So i can test the driver works okay with your product as well.

I did see i am able to order 1 demo product,
but shipment is over $40 and that is a lot given
i am just a private person and
i bring a driver to your products and more exposure.

thank you,
